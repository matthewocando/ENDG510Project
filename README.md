# IoT Malware Classifier
Author: Matthew Ocando

The contents of the `IoTMalwareClassifier.ipynb` notebook relay the creation of a DNN classifier capable of differenciating between benign and malware network packets in an IoT SMart Home setup. Additionally, the `model` folder contains 2 trained models responsible for the mentioned classification. 

All work on the DNN was done using the *fastai* python library.
